\section{Evaluation}

Cases: TS1 vs TS2

Performance Benchmark: Number of Events, Number of Nodes, Number of Processors -> Graphs
Real Life Benchmarks: RingBuffer -> subchapter Performance impact of instrumentation
                      Tracebench -> maybe one example
                      HTTP Server Logs?
                      Database Server Logs?
                      Other?

\section{Implementation Details}

TS1 vs TS2
Implicit greedy schedules with Call vs Fair schedules with cast
Evaluation Model: JSON parsing -> GenServer -> MessageQueue for inputs -> Evaluation of each Node \dots
