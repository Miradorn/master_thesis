\section{Further Work}
\label{sec:conclusion:further_work}

Composition of Transducers/evalEngines
Port to Scala/akka
Different evaluation model: Pull not push
port to genstage

Architecture is similar to a vm: Tessla specs are code, compiler produces intermediate representation (json), runtime executes Ir.
Therefore: Maybe define new functions (read nodes) in the spec itself and not in the runtime?

\subsection{Error prevention}
\label{sec:conclusion:further_work:error_prevention}
Ways of sending observations back to the program to recover from or prevent errors
