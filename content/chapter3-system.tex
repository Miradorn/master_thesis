\chapter{System}
\label{sec:system}

Let \(E\) be the Set of valid input events and \(e \in E\), where each event carries a value, a timestamp and the
channel it is perceived on (e.g.\ a function call of a specific function).
Further let \(O\) be the Set of valid output events and \(o \in O\), which have the same properties than input events.

\section{Semantics of TeSSLa functions}
Think of semantics of thinks like add, mrv, etc.
Can these be defined independent of async/synchronous or for each.
For synchronous they are partly defined in the TeSSLa spec

\section{Semantics of an ideal, synchronous evaluation Engine}
\label{sec:system:semantics_ideal}
An ideal implementation \(I\) for a specification \(T\) is one that consumes an input event \(e_x\) and immediately emits
appropriate output Events \(o_{1,1}, o_{1,2}, \dots , o_{1,x}\) with \(x \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge0}\) and changes it's internal
state \(S\) to save the fact, that the event \(e_x\) was received and optionally other properties generated by the
evaluation of the spec that are needed by later computations.

Therefore it's behaviour for a single input can be described by two functions:
\begin{align*}
    \Phi&: S \times E \rightarrow S \\
    \Theta&: S \times E \rightarrow O^*
\end{align*}

The behaviour for multiple inputs is the composition of the functions.

The semantics for the implementation \(I\) for a Stream of input events from \(E^*\) is given by the output Stream
from \(O^*\) that is generated by the formulas.

\section{Semantics of an asynchronous evaluation Engine}
\label{sec:system:semantics_async}

An asynchronous implementation \(A\) for a specification \(T\) has more complex characteristics:
It's state is defined by the product of the States of it's nodes, where each node represents a primitive operation in
the specification and the nodes are organized as a DAG.%TODO glossary
The output is specified by the concatination of outputs of the nodes that are marked as output nodes in the specification.

In contrast to \(I\) the asynchronous implementation takes multiple steps to produce an output from an input.
During a step multiple things can happen at once:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A new, external input Event can be consumed by a source in the DAG and is propagated to it's children
    \item Multiple internal Nodes, which have at least one new input buffered on their input queue can perform
        their computation and propagete their new output to their children.
    \item Multiple output nodes, which have at least one new input buffered on their input queue, can produce a
        new output.
\end{itemize}

The semantic of the implementation is given by the product of the semantics of it's nodes.

\section{Equality of Semantics}
\(A\) and \(S\) are considered equal if for a Series of input Events they produce the same output Events, or stated otherwise:
The equality is defined only over the traces they consume and produce.
\(A\) won't emit the outputs in the right order, but because each event holds the timestamp it was generated, they can
be reordered so that the output will be exactly the same as the one from \(I\)

\subsection{Equality of States}
To proof the equality of both systems we have to proof the equality of the states \(A\) will take, while producing the
outputs, to the States \(I\) takes.
Let \(e_1, e_2, \dots, e_x\) be the input events both implementations receive.
The State of \(I\) will change every time a new input is received and will produce all outputs that could be computed.
The processing of a series of 3 input events can be visualized like shown in Figure~\ref{fig:chap3:sec_equal:form_sync_processing}.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{flalign*}
        &\text{Timestamp:}  && t_0      &&t_1\                          &&t_2                        &&t_3 &\\
        &\text{Input:}      &&          &&e_1\                          &&e_2                        &&e_3 &\\
        &\text{State:}      && I_0      &&I_1\                          &&I_2                        &&I_3 &\\
        &\text{Outputs:}    &&          &&(o_{1,1}, \dots, o_{1,x})     &&(o_{2,1}, \dots, o_{2,y})  &&(o_{3,1}, \dots, o_{3,z}) &
    \end{flalign*}

\end{figure}

Due to the asynchronous nature of \(A\) there is no direct mapping from the states of \(I\) to the states of \(A\), because
\(A\) will compute outputs in a non deterministic order.
Therefore the equality has to be shown inductive over the possible States \(A\) could reach while computing the outputs.

Let's first reason about the easy case, were only one external event is received:
In this case \(I\) has only two states, \(I_0,\ I_1\) and will only produces outputs once: \(o_{1,1}, \dots, o_{1,x}\).
\(A\) will walk through multiple states, bound by the number of functions in the specification it's implementing.
Because the specification is a DAG, especially has no circles, eventually \(A\) has to finish it's computation, let the
number of steps be \(k\).
Let \(h_{\min}\) be the minimal height of the DAG (the height of the leave with the fewest steps to the Source).
The first output can only be created after \(h_{\min}\) steps and after step \(k\) all outputs have to be created, so that
\(o_{1,1}, \dots, o_{1,x}\) were emitted.
Let the States of \(A\) during the computation be \(A_{0}, A_{1,0}, A_{1,1}, \dots, A_{1,k}\) where \(A_0\) is the initial state.
When taking the first step and \(A_{1,0}\) is reached, the event \(e_1\) is consumed and no other node can compute.
Note that there is no alternative to this bahivour, because there were no prior events and therefore no internal Node
have an event to process on it's input queue, therefore the Source consuming the external event is the only node that can,
and therefore must, compute anything.
Afterwards all Nodes thar are direct children of the source that consumed event will have one input event buffered and
are able to perform their computation in the next step.
At least until step \(h_{\min}\) every step one or more Nodes, that are no outputs will perform a computation, therefore
pushing internal events closer to the output nodes.
Somewhere between step \(h_{\min}\) and \(k\) all internal events will reach an output node and produce an output.

A more complex case is when multiple events are received. To make the reasoning easier lets first assume, that the next
input event is only consumed, when all outputs based on the previous event were produced (therefore being kind of synchronous).
\(I\) will step through a series of States \(I_0, I_1, \dots, I_x\), A on the other hand will step through a Series of
states for each state that \(I\) takes: \(A_0,A_{1,0},A_{1,1},\dots,A_{1,j1},A_{2,0}, \dots,A_{x,j2}\).
Based on this behaviour lets define when a State of \(A\) is equal to one of \(I\):
The first states \(A_0\) and \(I_0\) are always assumed to be equal, because no output can be observed and therefore one
can't observe a difference.
A State \(A_{i,j}\) with \(j > 0\) is called equal to a State \(I_{i}\) iff:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The previous state \(A_{i,j-1}\) was equal to \(I_{i}\)
    \item and either
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No new output was generated at state \(A_{i,j}\)
        \item or if a new output \(o\) is created it is equal to one of the outputs of \(I_{i}\) that wasn't generated before
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A State \(A_{i,0}\) is called equal to a state \(I_{i}\) iff
\begin{itemize}
    \item The previous state \(A_{i-1,x}\) was equal to \(I_{i-1}\)
    \item the input \(e_i\) was consumed at the step
    \item and the States \(A_{i-1,0}\) to \(A{i-1,x}\) together produced the same output like \(I_{i-1}\)
\end{itemize}

Naively speaking the System \(A\) moves through states \(A_{i,0},\dots,A_{i,x}\) while it produces the same outputs as \(I\)
produced when it reached state \(I_i\), and as soon as the last output was produced consumes a new event and thereby takes
state \(A_{i+1,0}\).

Based on this, a series of states \(\vec{A}\) is called equal to a series of States \(\vec{I}\) if each state in \(\vec{A}\)
is equal to a state in \(\vec{I}\).
The System \(A\) is equal to the system \(I\) in regard to a series of inputs \(\vec{e}\) iff all possible series of
states it could take to process \(\vec{e}\) are equal to \(\vec{I}\).

Problem for multiple input events: an output event from \(I_2\) could be produced by \(A\) before all output events of \(I_1\) were produced
